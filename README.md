# Reco (react.cordova)


Welcome to `Reco` (React+Cordova). Reco unifies React.js and Cordova into one CLI which
bundles both platforms together and provides the developer with the ability to generate Cordova hybrid cross-platform 
applications built in React.js. This bundled platform facilitates and automates project initialization, 
compilation and build actions for React.js developers who wish to build web/mobile/desktop applications using the powerful and most vast Cordova environment. Reco is the bundle where both Cordova and React.js platforms merge and work together as one. Enjoy your
coding and development experience using Reco!
